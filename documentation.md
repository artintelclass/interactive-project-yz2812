## Motivation
Presentation nowadays becomes more frequently used in various occasions, and Ted Talk style presentation is getting more popular. However, in this kind of presentation, the speaker is usually in front of audience and backs to the screen, with walking around the stage during the presentation, which makes it difficult for them to have a sppech desk with a computer to swicth slides and remind them of the following content. To solve this issue, my project makes the mobilephone a remote of slides as well as the content-hint for speakers and therefore enable them to deliver better presentation.

## Introduction & Usage
With the help of Reveal.js, a javascript library generating presentation slide on javascript and html, users can geneate their slides in code of javascript and html, and even they are not familiar with code, they can use www.slides.com to design the slides and the website can automatically generate the corresponding codes, and by simply copying and paste in the websites connected to local server, speakers can start control their slides with their mobilephones as a remote control and check the slides with the mobilephone.

With the trained machine learning programs, when speakers tilt the mobilephone in certain directions while pressing the screen, the slides  on the screen (in the presentation webpage shown on the computer) will switch coresspondingly. 

Also, by clicking arrows on mobilephone's webpage. speakers can switch the slide on the mobilephone (which can be the same as the computer's presenting version or can contain more notes). 

In general, this interactive presentation assistve system enables speakers to easily switch the slides in Ted Talk style presentation without run to the computer to switch, and makes them easily check the slides and notes without staring at computer screen for information.

The data processing procedure starts from mobilephone website transfer data to Wekinator Inputhelper through local server,
